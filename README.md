## Description  
This projects creates a new note for a user to save amongst a list of notes. The user can add a title for their note, and text for the description of the note. This project was created using express js, and I worked on creating the routes from the home page to the note taker page. I added code to connect the existing front end to the back so that what the user submits is stored, and re-read when accessing an existing note. I will continue to work on the delete fucntion. 


## Usage
The note taker application can be used for the user to keep track of their list of notes, and have this list saved in the same place.
